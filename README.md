# Additional data files needed for testing specutils loaders

This repository exists to collect public data which for whatever reason lacks a
reliable host for the purposes of running the spectuils test suite and CI
system. This project is wired up to zenodo, and zenodo should be the canonical
place to access the data from.

## Licensing

The data within this repository has been released publicly (usually as part of a
survey or archive), though the exact license was released under may be unclear.
Hence no license file is included. Links to the origin of the data are below.

### 6dFGS

The data from 6dFGS is hosted at http://www-wfau.roe.ac.uk/6dFGS/, and will also
appear on https://datacentral.org.au/. As there is currently not a reliable
host for the purposes of testing/CI, some of the 6dFGS data files are hosted
here.
